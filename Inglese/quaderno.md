# Workbook
This is my english workbook, here sits everything english related. It has exercises, homeworks and a lot more.

## How is it sctructured?
The workbook has third-level titles for assignments etc...  
The structure for the headings of each task is very simple:  
`[Task] - [dd/mm/yy]`
Here's an example: `Homeworks - 10/06/25`
You can search this headings trough the document using the common `Ctrl+F` search, you can serch terms such as `Homeworks` or `xx/xx/xx` for the date.  
The Workbook is also divided in separate pages for homeworks, essays and regular workbook.  
You can find the pages with the links in this page.

### Division
Every day/lesson is divided by a straight line that marks the start and the end of a section. Here's an example
